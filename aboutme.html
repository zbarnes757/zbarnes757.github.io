				I am Virginia Beach, VA native who loves to travel, game, and read. My background is in mortgage underwriting but I gave all that up in March 2014 to pursue my true passion of travel and code. I spent 6 months living in South America. I spent most of my time teaching myself basic coding and meeting entrepreneurs in the area. I am now currently enrolled at Dev Bootcamp to study web development. I will be relocating to San Francisco in early 2015 to do their on site course and then to pursue my dream of working with startups in the area.

				I always try to find new projects to build that are going to stretch me as a developer. I find that I am most effective when I am in a situation that is just beyond my depth. I am constantly trying new things and using new technologies. I feel that if I ever become too complacent with my code, then it is time for me to shake things up.
			</p>

				When not coding, I enjoy reading, gaming, gardening, exploring nature, traveling, and watching Netflix. My favorite book series are The Name of the Wind, Song of Ice and Fire, and the Lord of the Rings. Some of my favorite shows are Game of Thrones (duh), Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders, and The Walking Dead. I love to explore new places and will take every opportunity I get to travel and do so.
