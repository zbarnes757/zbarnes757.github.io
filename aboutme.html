				I am Virginia Beach, VA native who loves to travel, game, and read. My background is in mortgage underwriting but I gave all that up in March 2014 to pursue my true passion of travel and code. I spent 6 months living in South America. I spent most of my time teaching myself basic coding and meeting entrepreneurs in the area. I am now currently enrolled at Dev Bootcamp to study web development. I will be relocating to San Francisco in early 2015 to do their onsite course and then to pursue my dream of working with startups in the area.
