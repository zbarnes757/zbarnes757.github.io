            I just finished watching a video by Claude M. Steele on Stereotype Threat. You are probably asking what the heck is that? The short and quick answer is that it is the feeling of risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. An example that Steele uses is about women taking higher level math tests in college. One group took the test normally. The other group was told that this test was passed equally by males and females. The end result was the first group saw a distinct difference in test scores, with females scoring much lower. The second group saw gap all but disappear. He continues to show various other examples in different settings. If you would like to know more, you can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">here</a> (be warned, it is over an hour long).

            Now, my first thought was what does a goofy white boy such as myself know about stereotypes? The truth is that stereotypes exist for all forms of identities that someone can have. My religion, color, level of education, mental capacities, political persuasion, and vocational history all play a part in how I perceive stereotype threat. I can tell you there have been numerous discussions where the fact I only have a high school diploma causes me to stop participating because I don't want to appear dumb. There are also discussions that happen on race relations where I feel that because I am white, I have no right to participate regardless of the fact half my family is black. In the moment, I never consciously acknowledge these feelings. It is always after the fact that I realize I missed an opportunity.

            I think that as I begin to move forward with this new awareness, there are several things I can do to try to avoid these feelings. The first is to realize that I am not defined by these labels. I am me and I only reflect who I am. I also want to be able to recognize the reverse in others. For example, I remember what it was like to feel like I was too young to participate. I want to be able to see that in others and encourage them that they are just as qualified as anyone else and we are all in this together. I think now that I have this knowledge, it will help me to be a better communicator and leader.
