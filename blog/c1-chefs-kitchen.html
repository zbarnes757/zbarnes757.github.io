            I just finished  watching the fireside chat with Shereef and let me tell you, I am pumped. Scared. But pumped. What I know for sure is that DBC is going to change my life. I see myself connecting with awesome people from all around over our love of coding. I also see a mountain of learning ahead that I will need to climb. Not an impossible climb, but definitely a climb that will take great effort. From what I learned from Shereef's talk, I learned that DBC is a startup like any other. It is growing and failing and iterating. That excites me. I am excited to be apart of this process and to go through the changes with them. I believe they are stiving to make their product the best and I want to help with that.

            When I get there I like to imagine myself jumping head first into everything. I see myself talking with everyone and participating in everything that is being offered. Unfortunately, I know from experience that I will be reserved for the first couple of weeks. My plan is to work my hardest to throw this part of me aside and pursue this with all that I have.

            I know that this learning environment with be the best for me. I can already feel myself learning more and more and it is ony phase 0. I can only imagine what will happen when I am onsite with everyone and diving into the curriculum. I honestly believe that these kinds of alternate education trade schools are the future. I am beyond excited to help shape that future with my participation.
