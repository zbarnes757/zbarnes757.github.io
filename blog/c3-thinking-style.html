            So coming into Dev Bootcamp, we had to take a test to figure out our individual learning styles. My test came back as Abstract Sequential (you can learn more <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">here</a>) The gist of this style is it allows me to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which I cannot actually see in a linear and logical fashion. Ok so that sounds pretty boring upfront. At first,  my thought was "Oh great, some label I have to stick to now." But after some digging, I realize there is much more to this. I found that this isn't something designed to box me in. Rather, it is there to provide direction. To show me where I am, and where to go from there.

            One of the characteristics of my learning type is that we prefer to learn/work alone. Part of the DBC cirriculum is to pair program regularly. As you can see, these two things do not mix. Now that I am aware of what is making me shy away from pairing, I can find ways to overcome that obstacle. Another draw back that comes with my learning style is an aversion to working with people of differing viewpoints. I can already tell that I will encounter many new perspectives during the course of this camp. I am already mentally prepping myself to be open minded and aware of where people are coming from.

            Luckily it isn't all struggles and things to overcome. Two of the ways that I learn best is with access to experts and references when needed and by being in a fast paced and stimulating environment. DBC is going to be the perfect place for these things. I know that the teachers are going to be fantastic aids to my learning. Part of the reason I applied was because I knew I needed these teachers. I also knew that the fast pace is something that I am going to thrive in.  
          </p>
          <p>
            As I go deeper into DBC, I plan to put myself in all the situations that are normally uncomfortable or different for me. I want to interact with people who think differently. I want to work with people more. I think that I will be able to broaden my thinking so much more the further into this we go.
