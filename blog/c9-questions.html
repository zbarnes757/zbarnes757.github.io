            So what makes a good question? We ask them all the time (if we are smart). But how do we know we are asking the right ones? Or phrasing them in such a way so others understand what we are asking? There are a lot of different things that come into play. In my experience, the biggest disconnect between the asker and the answerer is two things.

            Jargon is a huge barrier for questions. It sounds silly, but even within America we have colloquialisms that can hinder the questioning process. I am from the Southeast of the USA. I am now working with people predominately from the west coast. There are things that I say that they have no idea what I am talking about. When I go to ask things, I need to take a step back and think about my words. What other meanings do they have? Sometimes you need to simplify your words as much as possible to make sure people know what you are talking about.

            The real killer to questions is not understanding your audience's background and thought processes. I think we often jump to conclusions in our heads based on our experiences and knowledge base that our audience doesn't have. I know that I do it all the time. I think the only way to get around this is to think about what your audience is hearing from you and how they are processing it. This can be a difficult exercise but it does help you not only ask better questions but also learn more about your audience.
