            This will be a fairly short post this week. As you can clearly see, I have a website set up to host my blog, contact info, and a portfolio once I create one. Well, I wanted to take a little time to try some new designs and get feedback from my friends. I like to keep my designs very simple with minimal graphics. I personally find the contrast of color to be the best way to highlight content. From the 5 friends that look at the site, all said they liked the simple design. Their feedback all centered on little tweaks to improve the site. I took them under consideration and as long as they fell into my overall site plan.

            I really enjoyed getting to build this site and improve it over time. It feels good to have built something based entirely on my own creativity. I think it is a very real representation of who I am. Also, I now have a project that can grow with me. As I learn new things, I can add them to my site. I already have ideas on how to add more as I learn more things. I realize that the extent of my site is based solely on me and my growth as a programmer. I look forward to adding more.
